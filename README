Plan:
1. Write Preferences Code - FINISHED
2. Write Plugin Code - FINISHED
3. Write SQL Code (In Java) - PENDING
4. Test test test
4.5 Write HELP and Release
5. Write File Code

Ideas:
File Based  - Abstract out the work so we can just swap in the proper object at init. F'D this up a bit. - WORKING ON THIS
			- Write code to output to a file and do the "slow" linear lookup.
			- Possibly optimize it by making a "B+Tree<List>" to check which "chunk" we're in and find the applicable areas (chunks are 16x128x16 areas, y is up and down)
Optimizing 	- Decrease resolution to 2x2x2 block. (Half the number of rows)
			- Queue chunks of inserts (say 1000 at a time) and run those queries one per ???sec
